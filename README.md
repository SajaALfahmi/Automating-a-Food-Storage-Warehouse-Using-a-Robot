# Automating-a-Food-Storage-Warehouse-Using-a-Robot

#  Execution Algorithm

1. Initialization:
   - Start the robot system.
   - Calibrate all sensors and cameras to ensure functionality.

2. Item Detection:
   - Use a camera to scan the area for food items.
   - Identify and classify items using image recognition or QR code scanning.

3. Pick Item:
   - Move the robotic arm to the item's location.
   - Use the gripper to grab the item securely.

4. Transport to Storage:
   - Navigate to the appropriate location in the warehouse.
   - Follow predefined paths using sensors or mapping systems.

5. Place Item:
   - Release the item into the designated storage section.
   - Update the warehouse database with the new item location.

6. Repeat:
   - Return to the pickup area.
   - Repeat the process until all items are stored.

# Working Envelope Elements 
- Robot Type: Mobile robot with robotic arm.
- Arm movement range: 180 degrees horizontally, 50 cm vertically.
- Warehouse size: 10 meters (length) Ã— 5 meters (width).
- Shelf height range: 0.5 m to 2 m.
- Robot navigation range: up to 15 meters.
- Maximum load capacity: 5 kg per item.

  This project demonstrates a practical approach to automating food storage operations in a warehouse using a mobile robot equipped with a robotic arm. By integrating sensor calibration, item detection, path navigation, and database updates, the system ensures efficient and organized item handling. The proposed algorithm and working envelope are designed to optimize storage accuracy, reduce manual labor, and improve overall warehouse productivity. This automation model can be further enhanced with real-time monitoring, obstacle avoidance, and AI-driven optimization for future scalability.
